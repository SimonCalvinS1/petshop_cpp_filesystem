# Features and Functionalities
This cpp file contains OOPs concepts like dynamic memory allocation, constructors, destructors and virtual destructors, single inheritances, multilevel inheritances, multiple inheritances, hierarchical inheritances, runtime polymorphism, virtual functions and method overriding, operator overloading, static variables, static functions, friend functions, file I/O, time and date handling.

Main Function Flow:
- The program starts by initializing an Employee and calling e.start(), which displays a welcome message.
- It then creates and sets up different pet objects (for Birds, Dogs, and Aquaria).
- Operator overloading is demonstrated by using ++bird and !dog.
- Polymorphism is shown by having a base class pointer (Pet* petobj) point to different derived objects.
- Finally, a CustomerOrders object is used to simulate a purchase order.
- The order details are then printed and appended to the file.
